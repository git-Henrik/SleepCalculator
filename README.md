# SleepCalculator

Sleep Calculator is built using SwiftUI & CoreML

A machine learning model called SleepCalculator.mlmodel 
was trained to find the needed level of sleep based on 4 (improvised) factors. 

1. Wake up time
2. Estimated Sleep in hrs
3. Cups of coffee per day
4. Actual Sleep

The user will input a time they want to wake up and how many cups of coffee 
they have had and the recommended time for bed will be provided as an alert.
